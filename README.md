# Allegro - Student Messaging System

[Allegro](https://allegroapp.me) is an asynchronous messaging web application aimed at students.

## Deployment

Allegro requires PHP (version 8.0 or above) and MySQL. It is designed to work on Apache, but can easily be adapted for other HTTP servers. Code to create required database structure is included in `data/database.sql`. The folder `src/public/` must be served.
